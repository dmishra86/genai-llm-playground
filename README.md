This repository serves as a dynamic arena for exploring and experimenting with Generative Language Models (LLMs).

Learning about the Large Langauge Models (LLMs) and their evolution starts with understanding the basics of the Natural Langauge Processing (NLP) and progresses through various advancements and techniques.

# Roadmap:

## 1. Foundations of NLP:
    * Basics of NLP - text processing, tokenization, stemming and lemmatization.
    * Statistical methods in NLP - probabilistics langauge models (n-grams, Hidden Markov Models, CRFs etc.)
    * Machine Learning for NLP - naive bayes, Support Vector Machines (SVMs), and decision trees.
  
## 2. Evolution of LLMs:
    * Traditional NLP models: Early approaches to NLP, rule-based, hand-crafted features
    * Intro to Neural Networks:
    * Sequence Models:
    * Transformer Architecture: Attention is all you need paper.

## 3. Basics of LLMs::
    * BERT
    * GPT:
    * XLNet, RoBERTa, T5 etc.
    * Fine Tuning  LLMs

## 4. Advanced Topics in LLMs:
    * Ethical and societal implications:
    * Multimodal LLms
    * Continual Learning and Adaptation
    * Zero-shot and few-shot learning

## 5. Cutting edge research and future directions:
    * Recent advances
    * Interdisciplinary Applications
    * Open problems and Challenges
