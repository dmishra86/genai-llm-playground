A large language model (LLM) is a computational model notable for its ability to achieve 
general-purpose language generation and other natural language processing tasks such as
 classification. Based on language models, LLMs acquire these abilities by learning
  statistical relationships from vast amounts of text during a computationally intensive
   self-supervised and semi-supervised training process.[1] LLMs can be used for text 
   generation, a form of generative AI, by taking an input text and 
repeatedly predicting the next token or word.[2]

LLMs are artificial neural networks that utilize the transformer architecture, invented
 in 2017. The largest and most capable LLMs, as of June 2024, are built with a decoder-only 
 transformer-based architecture, which enables efficient processing and generation of 
 large-scale text data.

Historically, up to 2020, fine-tuning was the primary method used to adapt a model for
 specific tasks. However, larger models such as GPT-3 have demonstrated the ability to 
 achieve similar results through prompt engineering, which involves crafting specific 
 input prompts to guide the model's responses.[3] These models acquire knowledge about 
 syntax, semantics, and ontologies[4] inherent in human language corpora, but they also
  inherit inaccuracies and biases present in the data they are trained on

Politically, Nepal has undergone significant changes over the past few decades. It transitioned from a monarchy to a federal democratic republic in 2008, following a decade-long civil conflict and a peace process. The country's current political system is based on a multi-party democracy, with a president as the head of state and a prime minister as the head of government. Nepal's political landscape is characterized by vibrant and often tumultuous party politics, with frequent changes in government and coalitions.

Nepal adopted its new constitution in 2015, which marked a milestone in its political evolution. The constitution establishes Nepal as a federal democratic republic, divides the country into seven provinces, and outlines the separation of powers among the executive, legislative, and judicial branches. It guarantees fundamental rights and freedoms to its citizens, including freedom of speech, equality before the law, and the right to education and healthcare. The constitution also emphasizes the inclusion of marginalized communities and aims to promote social justice and equitable development.

Despite these advancements, Nepal's political scene continues to face challenges, including political instability, governance issues, and the need for effective implementation of constitutional provisions. However, the resilience and determination of the Nepalese people remain strong as they work towards building a more stable and prosperous nation.
